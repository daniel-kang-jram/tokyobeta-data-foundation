# Project: TokyoBeta Evidence Gold Dashboard Refresh

## Goal
Rebuild the production (gold-connected) Evidence dashboard into a KPI-centric operating cockpit with clearer business visibility, unified time controls, and validated metric definitions.

## Scope
- Refresh dashboard information architecture around core KPIs and actions.
- Port selected high-value views from snapshot dashboard into gold-connected dashboard.
- Add explicit metric timestamp/freshness UX to reduce reporting ambiguity.
- Add conversion funnel extension from application to move-in by profile.

## Requirements

### Validated
- Existing dashboard has usability gaps around KPI visibility and timestamp clarity.
- Current users need occupancy, rent, and revenue-per-available-room indicators at month-end checkpoints.

### Active
- [ ] Build KPI-centric homepage with occupancy, active rooms/tenants, RENT, RevPAR, and optional RecPAR(Cash).
- [ ] Bring Geography, Funnel Analysis, Pie Chart, and Segment views from snapshot into gold-connected Evidence.
- [ ] Add global or page-level time controls and visible "as-of" timestamps.
- [ ] Add conversion funnel from application to move-in by municipality and nationality.

### Out of Scope
- Full PMR process redesign beyond dashboard and metric modeling.
- Unapproved financial KPIs beyond explicitly requested metrics.

## Notes
Source feedback includes stakeholder email thread (Feb 2026) and annotated snapshot screenshots.

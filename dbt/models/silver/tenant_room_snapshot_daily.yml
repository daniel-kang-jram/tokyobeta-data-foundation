    description: |
      Daily incremental snapshot of active tenant-room pairs for occupancy tracking.
      
      Grain: One row per (snapshot_date, tenant_id, apartment_id, room_id).
      Materialization: Incremental (append-only by snapshot_date).
      Retention: 12 months in Aurora, older archived to S3.
      
      Volume: ~12,000 rows/day (~4.4M rows/year).
      
      Deduplication layers:
        1. rn=1 per (tenant_id, apartment_id, room_id): removes ~3,500 duplicate
           corporate contract records left open in staging.movings.
        2. is_room_primary=TRUE per (apartment_id, room_id): marks one authoritative
           tenant per physical room. Rooms in turnover (outgoing + incoming tenant
           simultaneously registered) retain both rows; only the current occupant
           is flagged TRUE. Use this for physical-room occupancy counting.
      
      Used by:
      - gold.occupancy_daily_metrics (KPI computation)
      - Analysis queries requiring tenant-level daily history
      
      **DATA QUALITY:**
      - dbt tests disabled (too slow on 1.5M+ rows, taking 5+ minutes)
      - Constraints validated by incremental date gating + downstream sanity checks
      - Verified during backfill and spot-checked via SQL queries

          Marks the authoritative tenant for physical-room occupancy counting.
          Priority: current occupants (入居中, 契約更新, 退去届受領) over scheduled
          arrivals (初回家賃入金, 仮予約). Use WHERE is_room_primary = TRUE to count
          occupied rooms as 1 per room regardless of turnover overlap.

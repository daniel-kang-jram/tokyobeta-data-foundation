⚠️  IMPORTANT: UPDATE RDS CREDENTIALS BEFORE DEPLOYING ⚠️

Edit this file: rds_cron_secret.tf

Find these lines (around line 18-23):

  secret_string = jsonencode({
    host     = "REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-RDS-ENDPOINT.rds.amazonaws.com"  ← CHANGE THIS
    username = "REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-USERNAME"                         ← CHANGE THIS
    password = "REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-PASSWORD"                         ← CHANGE THIS
    database = "gghouse"                                            ← Usually correct
    port     = 3306                                                 ← Usually correct
  })

HOW TO FIND YOUR CURRENT CREDENTIALS:
======================================

1. SSH into your EC2 instance:
   ssh ubuntu@<ec2-ip-address>

2. Look at your existing cron script:
   cat ~/cron_scripts/ggh_datatransit.sh | grep -E "DB_HOST|DB_USER|DB_PASS"

3. Copy those values into rds_cron_secret.tf

4. Save the file

5. Then run: terraform plan

AFTER UPDATING:
==============
- Delete this reminder file
- Continue with terraform apply
